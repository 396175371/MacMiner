MacMiner
========

Mac GUI interface for Bitcoin mining

Work in progress - if you know your way around xcode any tips or commits would be appreciated!

Some dependencies are not included here (for bfgminer and cpuminer)

installing curl and jansson through homebrew (or the .pkg installers for MacMiner) are necessary to run bfgminer

errors starting miners from build will probably point you to anything missing
