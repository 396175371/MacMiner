Mac Bitcoin, Litecoin and alt coin miner GUI interface for mining and monitoring networked miners

Work in progress - if you know your way around xcode any tips or commits would be appreciated!

The code is not provided here for bfgminer or it's api-example.c which is used to compile apiaccess, neither are cgminer or minerd (pooler's cpuminer) - these are available on github with their respective authors. Binaries are included here for ease of compilation.
